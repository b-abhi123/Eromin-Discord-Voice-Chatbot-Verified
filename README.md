A sample message to the AI. (It hasn't been updated to a recent model. It is an old AI model from sub 2020ish, so don't expect much. However, it can carry normal humanlike conversations pretty well!)

A sample character rolling system, where the user receives a "Common" card of that character. He must `claim` the character in the next 5 seconds to add it to his inventory.

## FAQ

#### Why is the bot not hosted anymore?

The free hosting service which I relied on for years has now stopped functioning. Due to the inability of paying for a new hosting service, I have terminated hosting Eromin. You can run this project locally, but issues may arise since the project is not maintained anymore.
